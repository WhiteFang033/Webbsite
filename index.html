                  <h3>  As I mentioned in the heading this is my second website. First one was itself named 'My First Website'. The source code was copied from my 8th standard computer book, no wonder. We were studying HTML(HyperText Markup Language), so you can consider that the first website was not an original but 'this' webiste can also be considered as " My First Original Website" and some day it will have its own pretty web address, which will pave a path for this website to be a chatting website or a blog someday...Until then Stay Safe Stay Happy! Ta Da...  (❁´◡`❁)                                                                                                                                                                                           </h3>
