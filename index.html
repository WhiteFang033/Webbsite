                  <h3>  As I mentioned in the heading this is my second website. The first one was itself named 'My First Website'. The source code was copied from my 8th standard computer book, no wonder. We were studying HTML(HyperText Markup Language), so you can consider that the first website was not an original but 'this' website can also be considered as " My First Original Website" and now it has its own pretty web address, which paved a path for this website to be a chatting website or a blog someday...For that, I'll have to use JavaScript...Until then Stay Safe Stay Happy! Ta-Da...  (❁´◡`❁)                                                                                                                                                                                           </h3>
